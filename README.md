# CFG Project
 Project by Maria and Umarah

To run the app in chrome:
- In visual studio code, go to file -> open folder -> locate to health-web -> open this folder
- On the side, it should open only the health-web folder, not the github stuff!
- Go to terminal -> new terminal
- type in "npm start" in terminal
It should open in chrome!
